If you need information about the use or reference manuals, you should go to the section built for this.
aboutProject_outputText_webApplicationDescription_value = The objective justifying the construction of this Web application lies in defining the scope and requirements of the project itself, since the high processing capacity and other system resources that can offer a computer as an application Server provides a strong point for successful and correct execution of all business processes created for the development of this project.<br /><br />On the other hand, having the centralized application in a client-server architecture will ensure high concurrency between users and avoid problems of application versions; similarly, facilitates maintenance and availability. You might think to make or implement all business processes on the same mobile application, but lack of resources and little logical and graphic processing of mobile devices, directly affect performance application, undoubtedly affecting the usability of the application itself.<br /><br />Due to the above, the web application has the function of receiving the parameters or values that define the exams session to grade automatically and which have been collected through the mobile application; and having this information available and validated largely, business processes begin to run the analysis and processing of digital images representing multiple choice exams to be evaluated, and subsequently to generate and send reports the results associated with each of the processed exams. In other words, the web application contains the code that solves the problem posed in this project.
aboutProject_outputText_androidApplicationDescription_value = The objective justifying the construction of this mobile application under Android platform lies in defining the scope and requirements of the project itself, since the idea under which the project was conceived was to offer a free and accessible application to every person requiring and want to automate the grading of multiple-choice exams under standard or using a base template.<br /><br />Thanks to this mobile application Android, everyone can access to the web application to automatically grade their multiple-choice exams performed in their academic courses, free and without problems with versions. Furthermore, since this mobile application can be parameterized some critical values that directly affect the performance of the automatic grading, some of these values are: maximum gain note, decimal accuracy or minimum percentage of correct answers to pass the exam.<br /><br />Without the use of this mobile application Android will not be able to access services and built processes and defined in this project for exams automatic scoring, ie no other means by which to conduct secure communication and reliable from any client on the network and server applications which has been deployed web application that contains all the business logic formulated for this project.
